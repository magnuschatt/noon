read in goal state from yaml file
read in world state from docker cli
stop docker containers in excess
start missing docker containers to reach goal state

example goal state:

services:
    - poky:
        image: poky
        count: 10
    - setty:
        image: setty
        count: 30

networking:
all containers have their own bridge network
with one other `tunnel` container in that network
this tunnel is available on http://tunnel:5436/
tunnel can attach auth header as it knows which service is calling
and forward the request in the form of a https request another tunnel instance the other.
question is: how do we indicate to the other local tunnel where we want to send the request
1) via a header? no this is not convenient in some cases (but this where we will start)
2) via a port on the tunnel instance? will run out of ports at some point
3) via the host part of the url, like http://service.tunnel:5436/path would be great


what will it look when it is running:

docker ps:
tunnel__0__setty
0__setty
tunnel__1__setty
1__setty
tunnel__2__setty
2__setty
tunnel__3__setty
3__setty
tunnel__0__poky
0__poky
tunnel__1__poky
1__poky

docker network ls:
network__0__setty
network__1__setty
network__2__setty
network__3__setty
network__0__poky
network__1__poky
