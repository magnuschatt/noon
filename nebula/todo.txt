read in goal state from yaml file
read in world state from docker cli
stop docker containers in excess
start missing docker containers to reach goal state

example goal state:

services:
    - poky:
        image: poky
        count: 10
    - setty:
        image: setty
        count: 30

networking:
all containers have their own bridge network
with one other `wormhole` container in that network
this wormhole is available on http://wormhole:5436/
wormhole can attach auth header as it knows which service is calling
and forward the request in the form of a https request another wormhole instance the other.
question is: how do we indicate to the other local wormhole where we want to send the request
1) via a header? no this is not convenient in some cases (but this where we will start)
2) via a port on the wormhole instance? will run out of ports at some point
3) via the host part of the url, like http://service.wormhole:5436/path would be great
